# Hi, IÂ´m Henrique Sicilia ðŸ‘‹

## Intro

As a Back-end Developer specialized in Java, my focus is always on delivering robust and efficient solutions that bring real value to the company. With a strong foundation in SQL and experience gained since college, I am constantly seeking to improve and stand out, allowing me to effectively tackle complex challenges.

During my studies, I had the opportunity to develop a complete program, from front-end to database, which gave me a broad perspective on the development cycle and taught me the importance of each stage in the success of a project. This experience has prepared me to handle end-to-end projects, always aiming for the best performance and quality.

I continually challenge myself to use the best resources and practices available in the market, with the goal of not only meeting established goals but exceeding them. I strive to contribute with solutions that not only solve problems but also drive innovation and efficiency within the company.

My goal is to collaborate on challenging projects that enable the company to reach new levels of success, delivering concrete and lasting results.
